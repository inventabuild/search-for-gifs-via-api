# search-for-gifs-via-api

User looking for a GIF enters a search word in the projects input box and a fetch of the first 20 gifs from GIPHY's api is displayed.

Future iterations will include the option of a compilation of GIF searches from more than one api, sticker searches and fetching more than 20 gifs at at time.
